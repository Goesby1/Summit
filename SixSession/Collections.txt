1.Make a Map that associates the following employee IDs with names. 
Keys and values of Maps can be any Object type, so in real life 
you would probably have the key be a String and the associated value 
be a Person or Employee object. To make things simpler on this exercise, 
you can use String for both the ID and the name, rather than bothering to 
create a Person or Employee class. The point here is to associate keys with values,
 then retrieve values later based on keys.
